# ESTR2102-Practice

This repository stores my notes and codes for some of the problems in the question book from the course CSCI2100A/ESTR2102 Data Structure in the Chinese University of Hong Kong(CUHK).

The codes will be updated from March 10, 2021, hopefully one question every day. **Please be noted that all solutions of the questions in the assignment will be posted after the late due date. So please do your own work.**

The problem source and related online judge platform is provided so that you can check your code and see other sample solutions by yourself.

For any enquiry, please approach me at <admin@hsguo.email>. **You are welcomed to pull requests.**
